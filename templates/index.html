        Discipline in typography is a prime virtue. Individuality
        must be secured by means that are rational. Distinction
        needs to be won by simplicity and restraint. It is equally
        true that these qualities need to be infused wiht a
        certain spirit and vitality, or they degenerate into
        dullness and mediocrity.
